## Index

The index page is a list of dictionaries that can be used. We may or may not split a study field into introduction and advanced.

Each dictionary stands with a physical metaphor like a dictionary, and the cover is supposed to have background. The background is given in `style` attribute. The list of dictionaries is given within `index.js` and it's compiled `index.min.js`.

## Inside

The view is split into 3 parts: navbar, term & explanation, and frequency assigning (not implemented at first). Footer may apply.
