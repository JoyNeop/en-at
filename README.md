# English (A.T.)

English (Academic Terminologies) in a nut.

## Why

For English learners from China, especially those who don't live in a real English environment, remembering a lot of terminologies (e.g. legal terms, math terms, chemistry terms, philosophy terms) is difficult. They don't even have a tool to extend their vocabulary to these fields. Almost every flashcard-based vocabulary utility app is designed for passing tests like TOEFL/IELTS/SAT/GRE only. Therefore, it comes necessary to develop a flashcard-based tool for such need.

## Roadmap

Currently I am developing it in the web way. If the need gets affirmed by the users, I may develop account system and forgetting curve tracking. And it will be good to extend the experience for mobile devices crossing the platforms.
